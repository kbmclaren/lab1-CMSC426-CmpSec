# lab1-CMSC426-CmpSec
## Description
Lab 1 focused on the execution of a buffer overflow attack variant known as 'Return-to-libc'.<br>
This lab was introductory in that Address Space Layout Randomization, StackGuard Protection, and the non-executable stack setting were all disabled for the duration of this lab, as described in "return_to_libc_official.pdf".<br>
## Repo Contents 
- "Lab 1 - Group 10 - Fall 2021 - CMSC 426.pdf" : This pdf must contain the answers to the professors questions found in return_to_libc_official.pdf.<br>
- "README.md"<br>
- "exploit.py" - The locations of the override instructions are adjusted here. When run, the file "badfile" is generated and contains the attack string loaded by retlib.c<br>
- "retlib.c" - This file imports the attack string, generated by exploit.py, and overwrites the buffer with the attack string.
